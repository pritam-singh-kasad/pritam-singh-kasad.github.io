My Grand father, a man that is worldly known. 
Travelling to many countries, having his poetry praised and shown. 

He has experienced life taking the good along with the bad. 
Always remaining jolly, you'll never see him sad. 

My Grand father, the eldest of a family what was very very large 
He always helped the family and was the one who took charge. 

These qualities are what helped him as he grew older. 
Taking care of his wife and carrying six kids on his shoulders. 

My Grand father, the six children he raised along with his wife. 
All became a success later on life. 

He educated them well about life and in school. 
His Teaching guided his children to be nice and not cruel. 

My Grand father has worked so hard to educate his mind. 
That has brought him good fortune and he remains to stay kind. 

He educated himself while putting his kids through school. 
He believed that education was life and essenial tool. 

My Grand father, his passion for poetry can not be matched on the earth. 
The poems he writes are of great value and worth. 

There are many poets who have the talent to just read or the talent to just write. 
He possess the full package and watching him perform is an amazing sight. 

My Grand father a man who has remained a loyal INDIAN CIITIZEN. 
He continue to help the unfortunate. despite how much he has risen. 

Helping others first is a quality that is rare. 
His God like features truly shows he Cares. 

My Grand father a man that I admire and that is close to me. 
I hope he stays with us living long. happy and free.
